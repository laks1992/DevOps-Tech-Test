# ECS EC2 vs ECS Fargate (short)

| Aspect | ECS with EC2 (we manage servers) | ECS Fargate (serverless) |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | You pay for the EC2 instances even if they're not full | You pay per task resources (CPU/memory) used — can be more efficient at small scale
| Scalability | You must scale the ASG and manage AMIs and capacity | AWS scales for you automatically per task
| Operations | More work: patching, AMI updates, capacity planning | Less ops work — easier to run at scale
| Use case | Good when you need custom AMIs or control over instances | Good for simpler deployments and less ops overhead

Short conclusion: EC2 gives control, Fargate gives simplicity.
